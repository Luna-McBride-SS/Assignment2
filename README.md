# Assignment2

This is the second assignment of those done for Smoothstack. This includes a main class for execution, a math class for the add and max methods (the maths), and various shape classes to implement the shape interface. I have not been told what to do with the display function, so unless told otherwise (when I would fix it), I am leaving it blank for now. I would like to mess with the Java Graphics2D for it when I have a bit more time.
